### Introducing RDogeTip, the simplest way to tip other reddit users with doge!

Personally, I always forget the syntax for tipping other users (Is it +/u/doge_tip_bot? -/u/dogetipbot? Who knows!), and I wanted a simpler way to do things. So, I created a simple user script to help me tip users better!

Installation is simple, as this is a user-script.

1. Install a tool for running a user-script in your browser:
   - Firefox Users: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
   - Chrome Users: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
   - Safari Users: [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit)
2. Once you have that, you should be able to install this script by simply clicking this link:  
    https://github.com/richardjrossiii/RDogeTip/raw/master/RDogeTip.user.js  
    If you'd like an easy way to tip all users in a thread, try this script instead:  
    https://github.com/richardjrossiii/RDogeTip/raw/master/RDogeTipAll.user.js
3. And that's it! Start tipping users with your Doge!
