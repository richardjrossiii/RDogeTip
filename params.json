{"name":"RDogeTip","tagline":"Easily tip other reddit users with doge!","body":"### Introducing RDogeTip, the simplest way to tip other reddit users with doge!\r\n\r\nPersonally, I always forget the syntax for tipping other users (Is it +/u/doge_tip_bot? -/u/dogetipbot? Who knows!), and I wanted a simpler way to do things. So, I created a simple user script to help me tip users better!\r\n\r\nInstallation is simple, as this is a user-script.\r\n\r\n1. Install a tool for running a user-script in your browser:\r\n   - Firefox Users: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)\r\n   - Chrome Users: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)\r\n   - Safari Users: [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit)\r\n2. Once you have that, you should be able to install this script by simply clicking this link:  \r\n    https://github.com/richardjrossiii/RDogeTip/raw/master/RDogeTip.user.js\r\n3. And that's it! Start tipping users with your Doge!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
